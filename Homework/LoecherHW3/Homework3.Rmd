#### This homework is the absolute minimum extra work that you need to invest to keep up with the material in this course.

1. Review your understanding of **linear regression** using the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)
  * Read chapters 3.1, 3.2.1, 3.3.1 
  * Reproduce Lab Exercises 3.6.4 (Interaction Terms) and 3.6.6 (Qualitative Predictors)


2. Load the `titanic` library and the `titanic_train` data. In the following we use `Survived` as the outcome (y):
   * fit a model containing the interactions between `Sex` and `Pclass`. Interpret the coefficients.
   * fit a model containing the interactions between `Sex` and `age`. Interpret the coefficients.
   * fit a model containing the interactions between `Sex`, `Pclass` and `age`. Interpret the coefficients.
