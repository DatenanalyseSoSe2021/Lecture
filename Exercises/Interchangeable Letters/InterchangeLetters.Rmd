### Step 1 
Write a function that randomly interchanges all the letters of a word.
```{r}
interchange.word = function(inputString){
  WordVect = unlist(strsplit(inputString,split = ""))
    paste(WordVect[sample(1:nchar(inputString))],collapse = "")
}
interchange.word("of")
```

### Step 2
Now write a function that exchanges only the characters of the middle of the word (between Ô¨Årst and last character) Use your function from step 1. The function should not change anything, if the word is composed of less than 4 characters.  
The function has an argument called `exclude` which is vector of potential punctuation marks at the end of a word. You can assume that there is only one possible punctuation mark. If there is such a mark, it should not be changed and not counted towards the number of characters the actual word is composed of. Hence, `Tes.` is a three-character word and therefore nothing will be changed. Use the following vector of punctuation marks: `exclude=c(",",".","!","?")`.

```{r}
interchange.middle.of.word = function(string,exclude=c(",",".","!","?")){
  #  Regular Expression for gsub
  ExcludeRegEx = paste(c("[",exclude,"]","$"),collapse = "")
  # Remove excluded chars
  CharOnly = gsub(ExcludeRegEx,"",string)
  #Generate Vector
  CharOnly.Vec = unlist(strsplit(CharOnly,split = ""))

  if (nchar(CharOnly) < 4)
  return(string)
  else 
    paste(
      c(
        CharOnly.Vec[1],
        interchange.word(
          substr(
            CharOnly,2,
            length(CharOnly.Vec)-1
          )
        ),
        substring(string,length(CharOnly.Vec))
      ),
    collapse = "")

}
interchange.middle.of.word("H123456o!")
interchange.middle.of.word("Test")
interchange.middle.of.word("Yes?")
interchange.middle.of.word("Tes")
```
